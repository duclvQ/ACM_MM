3.311--->4.131	SPEAKER_00: Hey, check this out.
4.512--->6.633	SPEAKER_00:You know what Eric asked me when I got into work this morning?
6.653--->8.373	SPEAKER_01:I have no idea.
8.393--->9.294	SPEAKER_01:What did he ask you?
9.894--->11.975	SPEAKER_00:He asked me if I felt the earthquake last night.
13.236--->13.996	SPEAKER_01:Earthquake?
14.416--->15.577	SPEAKER_01:You've got to be kidding.
15.597--->16.737	SPEAKER_01:I didn't feel an earthquake.
17.017--->18.038	SPEAKER_00:I know, that's what I said.
18.578--->20.579	SPEAKER_00:He told me it actually woke him up last night.
21.596--->27.598	SPEAKER_00: You know, yeah, it was like it went, it happened at like, uh, four 42 in the morning.
27.758--->38.14	SPEAKER_00:So we must've been sleeping, but I mean, it's possible that, you know, even if we had been awake, we might not have felt it because you know, maybe it, uh, wasn't felt, you know, this far North.
38.801--->42.262	SPEAKER_00:But, uh, I mean, I thought he was pulling my leg when he first talked about it.
43.282--->47.343	SPEAKER_01:Well, I guess that's not so farfetched considering we live on a major fault line here.
48.308--->68.983	SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but actually I think this earthquake was on a different fault line, because Eric lives just south of San Jose, and the earthquake, he said, was due east of San Jose, so he was obviously a lot closer to the epicenter than we were, so I'm not even sure it was felt here.
69.604--->70.925	SPEAKER_01:Yeah, that makes sense.
73.052--->79.497	SPEAKER_01: You know, I've experienced quite a few earthquakes in the past several years, but I've been living here now a little over two years.
79.537--->81.659	SPEAKER_01:I've, I think I've only experienced one here.
82.339--->83.84	SPEAKER_01:It was really strange too.
83.901--->98.352	SPEAKER_01:I was, um, each, I should say each earthquake has been a completely different experience, but the one I, the one I felt here, I was standing outside a restaurant talking to AJ and another friend, and all of a sudden it just felt like
99.793--->100.614	SPEAKER_01: this shift.
100.654--->110.222	SPEAKER_01:It's really hard to explain, but it made me think of like a cartoon, like how in the cartoon, like buildings might just shift to the right and then shift right back.
111.323--->112.264	SPEAKER_00:Yeah, without falling.
112.784--->113.605	SPEAKER_01:Yeah, without falling.
113.845--->118.149	SPEAKER_01:And I had no idea what was going on for a few minutes afterwards.
118.189--->120.551	SPEAKER_01:And then I realized, oh, that must have been an earthquake.
121.332--->121.472	SPEAKER_00:Yeah.
121.492--->123.013	SPEAKER_00:You know what I usually notice?
123.354--->124.715	SPEAKER_00:The times that I've been at home,
125.698--->148.476	SPEAKER_00: here and uh... there's been an earthquake it's almost as if there's this really big train or like a gigantic mac truck going by and uh... suddenly i start to hear the heater shaking and uh... it's like a the noise is like uh... is loud for like a second and it's gone
149.583--->157.81	SPEAKER_00: It's really weird, you know, it's almost like the first couple of times I felt it, I wasn't even aware it was an earthquake while it was happening.
158.691--->165.637	SPEAKER_01:Well, that's so funny you say that because one that I experienced in Bangkok, it actually was after the tsunami.
166.277--->171.081	SPEAKER_01:And so later I found out that it was aftershock from the tsunami.
171.402--->174.624	SPEAKER_01:But anyway, I was in a building up on the ninth floor.
175.755--->179.717	SPEAKER_01: And suddenly there was all this rattling.
180.698--->184.7	SPEAKER_01:And I'm thinking to myself, it's just it was so irrational.
184.74--->191.244	SPEAKER_01:I'm thinking to myself, God, there's like a train going by and I can't believe that this building is shaking so much from the train.
194.6--->200.482	SPEAKER_01: Of course, a train wouldn't have made a building, or at least me up on the ninth floor, feel something to that effect.
201.262--->203.723	SPEAKER_01:I think it happened about two times.
203.743--->209.585	SPEAKER_01:That one wasn't until several days later when I was talking to people and they were like, oh, did you feel the earthquake?
209.605--->212.546	SPEAKER_01:Then it dawned on me, oh, that was an earthquake.
214.046--->214.746	SPEAKER_00:Yeah, I know.
215.847--->219.328	SPEAKER_00:It's crazy how when you're not used to feeling them, you could think it's something else.
219.693--->219.973	SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
220.433--->221.254	SPEAKER_00:I mean, yeah, totally.
221.574--->225.096	SPEAKER_00:I've been living here for a while now and I've definitely felt my share of earthquakes.
225.156--->228.517	SPEAKER_00:I mean, you know, when you live here, it's a given that you're going to experience earthquakes.
228.798--->231.099	SPEAKER_00:You just hope that you're not going to be here for the big one.
231.119--->232.459	SPEAKER_00:Right.
233.76--->241.384	SPEAKER_00:When I first moved here, it was, uh, about five years after the Loma Prieta earthquake, which was a very big earthquake here.
242.184--->249.388	SPEAKER_00:And, um, there are a lot of people who lived here who I met who had actually been living in the area when the earthquake hit.
249.864--->251.665	SPEAKER_00: So it was interesting to get their perspective.
252.486--->258.429	SPEAKER_00:And it also made me remember where I was when I heard about the Loma Prieta earthquake.
258.85--->265.794	SPEAKER_00:I was watching the World Series on TV, and it was taking place in San Francisco.
266.574--->275.38	SPEAKER_00:So as I'm watching it, suddenly the announcer starts saying, wow, I think we're feeling an earthquake here.
275.8--->277.301	SPEAKER_00:And the cameras started shaking.
278.597--->280.618	SPEAKER_00: All of a sudden, the TV coverage cut out.
282.78--->285.602	SPEAKER_00:I wanted to get a rundown of what happened, so I turned to the news station.
287.543--->293.748	SPEAKER_00:Within a few minutes, they were discussing this gigantic earthquake that had hit San Francisco.
294.188--->301.854	SPEAKER_00:They started showing pictures, maybe 30 minutes later, of these people who were trying to weed through the rubble.
302.267--->304.868	SPEAKER_00: of these buildings that had been like coming down.
305.348--->307.61	SPEAKER_00:So, I mean, it was pretty scary.
307.65--->309.19	SPEAKER_00:I'll tell you why.
309.27--->309.45	SPEAKER_00:Yeah.
309.891--->315.313	SPEAKER_01:Yeah, well, you know, the three months I was living in Japan, I experienced two.
316.494--->323.017	SPEAKER_01:Both of those were very different, very different from the one I'd experienced here and also very different from the one in Bangkok.
323.097--->331.081	SPEAKER_01:But one of them, I was actually up in my apartment which was on the fifth floor of a building and I was woken up at about 5 o'clock in the morning to the building swaying.
331.809--->340.776	SPEAKER_01: And because earthquakes are like a dime a dozen in Japan, they've built a lot of their buildings to absorb the shock.
341.657--->342.838	SPEAKER_01:So that's why it was swaying.
342.858--->344.899	SPEAKER_01:It was really, it was a very surreal feel.
347.681--->349.163	SPEAKER_01:Hi, this is Kristen Dodds.
349.603--->350.684	SPEAKER_00:And this is Joe Weiss.
