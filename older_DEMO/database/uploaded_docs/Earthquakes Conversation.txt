from 3.294 to 4.095	SPEAKER_00: Hey, check this out.
from 4.475 to 6.597	SPEAKER_00:You know what Eric asked me when I got into work this morning?
from 6.617 to 8.339	SPEAKER_01:I have no idea.
from 8.359 to 9.28	SPEAKER_01:What did he ask you?
from 9.88 to 11.942	SPEAKER_00:He asked me if I felt the earthquake last night.
from 13.224 to 13.984	SPEAKER_01:Earthquake?
from 14.405 to 15.526	SPEAKER_01:You've got to be kidding.
from 15.566 to 16.727	SPEAKER_01:I didn't feel an earthquake.
from 16.987 to 18.008	SPEAKER_00:I know, that's what I said.
from 18.028 to 20.571	SPEAKER_00:He told me it actually woke him up last night.
from 21.581 to 27.562	SPEAKER_00: You know, yeah, it was like it went, it happened at like, uh, four 42 in the morning.
from 27.742 to 38.124	SPEAKER_00:So we must've been sleeping, but I mean, it's possible that, you know, even if we had been awake, we might not have felt it because you know, maybe it, uh, wasn't felt, you know, this far North.
from 38.764 to 42.225	SPEAKER_00:But, uh, I mean, I thought he was pulling my leg when he first talked about it.
from 43.265 to 47.306	SPEAKER_01:Well, I guess that's not so farfetched considering we live on a major fault line here.
from 48.271 to 52.212	SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but actually, I think this earthquake was on a different fault line.
from 53.553 to 58.455	SPEAKER_00:Because, you know, Eric lives just south of San Jose.
from 58.895 to 59.135	SPEAKER_01:Yeah.
from 59.595 to 63.917	SPEAKER_00:And the earthquake, he said, was due east of San Jose.
from 64.137 to 66.978	SPEAKER_00:So he was obviously a lot closer to the epicenter than we were.
from 67.058 to 68.959	SPEAKER_00:So I'm not even sure it was felt here.
from 69.559 to 70.919	SPEAKER_01:Yeah, that makes sense.
from 71.98 to 75.161	SPEAKER_01:Well, you know, I've experienced quite a few earthquakes
from 75.97 to 79.472	SPEAKER_01: in the past several years, but I've been living here now a little over two years.
from 79.512 to 81.634	SPEAKER_01:I've, I think I've only experienced one here.
from 82.314 to 83.815	SPEAKER_01:It was really strange too.
from 83.875 to 100.606	SPEAKER_01:I was, um, each, I should say each earthquake has been a completely different experience, but the one I, the one I felt here, I was standing outside a restaurant talking to AJ and another friend and all of a sudden it just felt like this shift.
from 100.646 to 104.388	SPEAKER_01:It's really hard to explain, but it made me think of like a cartoon, like how
from 106.363 to 110.186	SPEAKER_01: in the cartoon, like buildings might just shift to the right and then shift right back.
from 111.287 to 112.227	SPEAKER_00:Yeah, without falling.
from 112.748 to 113.568	SPEAKER_01:Yeah, without falling.
from 113.828 to 118.131	SPEAKER_01:And I had no idea what was going on for a few minutes afterwards.
from 118.151 to 120.513	SPEAKER_01:And then I realized, oh, that must have been an earthquake.
from 121.294 to 121.434	SPEAKER_00:Yeah.
from 121.454 to 122.975	SPEAKER_00:You know what I usually notice?
from 123.315 to 135.944	SPEAKER_00:The times that I've been at home here and there's been an earthquake, it's almost as if there's this really big train or like a gigantic Mack truck going by.
from 136.713 to 148.477	SPEAKER_00: And suddenly, I start to hear the heater shaking, and it's like the noise is loud for like a second, and then it's gone.
from 149.397 to 151.518	SPEAKER_00:So it's really weird.
from 151.578 to 157.78	SPEAKER_00:It's almost like the first couple of times I felt it, I wasn't even aware it was an earthquake while it was happening.
from 158.66 to 165.542	SPEAKER_01:Well, that's so funny you say that, because one that I experienced in Bangkok, it actually was after the tsunami.
from 166.226 to 171.05	SPEAKER_01: And so later I found out that it was aftershock from the tsunami.
from 171.37 to 179.697	SPEAKER_01:But anyway, I was in a building up on the ninth floor and suddenly there was all this rattling.
from 180.698 to 184.701	SPEAKER_01:And I'm thinking to myself, it was so irrational.
from 184.741 to 191.227	SPEAKER_01:I'm thinking to myself, God, there's like a train going by and I can't believe that this building is shaking so much from the train.
from 194.586 to 201.229	SPEAKER_01: Of course, a train wouldn't have made a building, or at least me up on the ninth floor, feel something to that effect.
from 201.249 to 203.71	SPEAKER_01:I think it happened about two times.
from 203.73 to 209.552	SPEAKER_01:That one wasn't until several days later when I was talking to people and they were like, oh, did you feel the earthquake?
from 209.572 to 212.513	SPEAKER_01:Then it dawned on me, oh, that was an earthquake.
from 214.034 to 214.714	SPEAKER_00:Yeah, I know.
from 214.914 to 219.296	SPEAKER_00:It's crazy how when you're not used to feeling them, you could think it's something else.
from 220.41 to 225.054	SPEAKER_00: I mean, I've been living here for a while now and I've definitely felt my share of earthquakes.
from 225.134 to 228.497	SPEAKER_00:I mean, you know, when you live here, it's a given that you're going to experience earthquakes.
from 228.777 to 231.099	SPEAKER_00:You just hope that you're not going to be here for the big one.
from 233.741 to 241.367	SPEAKER_00:When I first moved here, it was about five years after the Loma Prieta earthquake, which was a very big earthquake here.
from 242.168 to 249.374	SPEAKER_00:And, um, there are a lot of people who lived here who I met who had actually been living in the area when the earthquake hit.
from 249.83 to 251.631	SPEAKER_00: So it was interesting to get their perspective.
from 252.451 to 258.414	SPEAKER_00:And it also made me remember where I was when I heard about the Loma Prieta earthquake.
from 258.834 to 265.778	SPEAKER_00:I was watching the World Series on TV, and it was taking place in San Francisco.
from 266.538 to 275.362	SPEAKER_00:So as I'm watching it, suddenly the announcer starts saying, wow, I think we're feeling an earthquake here.
from 275.782 to 277.263	SPEAKER_00:And the cameras started shaking.
from 277.902 to 280.584	SPEAKER_00: And all of a sudden, the TV coverage cut out.
from 281.384 to 284.066	SPEAKER_00:So I wanted to get a rundown of what happened.
from 284.086 to 293.732	SPEAKER_00:So I turned to the news station, and within a few minutes, they were discussing this gigantic earthquake that had hit San Francisco.
from 294.032 to 301.837	SPEAKER_00:And they started showing pictures, maybe 30 minutes later, of these people who were trying to weed through the rubble
from 302.253 to 304.853	SPEAKER_00: of these buildings that had been like coming down.
from 305.314 to 307.594	SPEAKER_00:So, I mean, it was pretty scary.
from 307.614 to 308.534	SPEAKER_00:I'll tell you why.
from 309.054 to 309.414	SPEAKER_00:Yeah.
from 309.874 to 315.275	SPEAKER_01:Yeah, well, you know, the three months I was living in Japan, I experienced two.
from 316.455 to 322.997	SPEAKER_01:Both of those were very different, very different from the one I'd experienced here and also very different from the one in Bangkok.
from 323.057 to 331.038	SPEAKER_01:But one of them, I was actually up in my apartment which was on the fifth floor of a building and I was woken up at about 5 o'clock in the morning to the building swaying.
from 331.772 to 340.758	SPEAKER_01: And because earthquakes are like a dime a dozen in Japan, they've built a lot of their buildings to absorb the shock.
from 341.639 to 342.8	SPEAKER_01:So that's why it was swaying.
from 342.84 to 344.861	SPEAKER_01:It was really, it was a very surreal feel.
from 347.903 to 349.144	SPEAKER_01:Hi, this is Kristen Dodds.
from 349.564 to 350.645	SPEAKER_00:And this is Joe Weiss.
from 351.385 to 358.93	SPEAKER_00:And we just wanted to let you know that this material is copyrighted in the year 2008 by Learn Real English LLC.
